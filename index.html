  <h1> <center> Farmer's Friends! </center> <h1>
  <p> <span style="font-weight:normal">   <font size="-0.5"> In today's economic climate, farmers are faced with an increasing need to manage their resources efficiently and effectively.  
      The goal is to, in simple terms, produce the largest amount of high-quality product, with as few a number of resources as possible. 
      Through a regional analysis of climate across the UK, this application aims to aid farmers in establishing top farming locations to grow various crops.  
      Specifically, Farmer's Friends looks at the UK's rainfall and sunshine data over the previous century. This web application allows new farmers to pick a location within the UK that would best
      suit their future crop's needs to allow for effective harvesting! </font> <p>
